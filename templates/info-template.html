        <h3>What is Join?</h3>
        <span>
            <span class="join-highlight">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
            group of dedicated students as part
            of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br><br>
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="join-highlight">Join</span> leverages the
            principles of kanban to help users
            manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.<br><br>
            It is important to note that <span class="join-highlight">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
            and is not intended for extensive
            business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent

                        information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the

                        details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>

                        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                        card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                        this action is irreversible.<br><br>
